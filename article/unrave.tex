\begin{abstract}
The Milky Way may be our greatest laboratory for understanding galaxy formation.
This premise relies on the ability to precisely determine the astrometry and
chemistry for many individual stars, and to use those data to make inferences
about the Galaxy's formation and evolution. On 14 September 2016 the \gaia\ 
mission will release precise astrometry for $\approx2\times10^6$ stars.  
However, a comprehensive catalog of detailed chemical abundances to complement
those data is currently lacking.  The RAdial Velocity Experiment (\rave) survey 
has acquired spectra for 292,036 stars in common with the first \gaia\ data 
release, constituting the largest overlap of any stellar spectroscopic sample.  
Here we perform an independent analysis of \rave\ spectra using an implementation
of \thecannon\ that uses prior probabilities on atomic line formation and stellar
astrophysical parameters.  Our approach yields precise stellar labels at lower 
S/N ratios than most \emph{ab initio} approaches, allowing us to deliver improved
radial velocities, effective temperature $\teff$, surface gravity $\logg$, and 
chemical abundances of up to seven elements (O, Mg, Al, Si, Ca, Fe, Ni) for 
\Nstars\ stars.  We validate our results internally from repeat visits, and 
externally against existing high-resolution spectroscopic surveys.  The typical
precision in chemical abundances is X.XX~dex.  We provide spectrophotometric 
distances based on our labels, improving upon the parallax distances available
for the fainter targets in the first \gaia\ data release. \stub{A one-line

\section{Introduction} 
\label{sec:introduction}

The Milky Way is considered to be the best laboratory for understanding galaxy
formation and evolution.  This premise hinges on the ability to precisely measure 
the astrometry and chemistry for (many) individual stars, and to use those data 
to infer the structure, kinematics, and chemical enrichment of the Galaxy 
\citep[e.g.,][]{Schlaufman_2009,Deason_2011,Ness_2012,Ness_2013a,Ness_2013b,
Casey_2012,Casey_2013,Casey_2014a,Casey_2014b,Bovy_2016}.  However, these 
quantities are not known for even 1\% of stars in the Milky Way.  Stellar 
distances are famously imprecise \citep[e.g.,][]{van_Leeuwen_2007,Jofre_2015,
Madler_2016}, proper motions can be plagued by unquantified systematics from 
the first epoch observations \citep[e.g.,][]{Casey_Schlaufman_2015}, and 
stellar spectroscopists frequently report significantly different chemical 
abundance patterns for the same star \citep{Smiljanic_2014}.  The impact 
these issues have on scientific inferences cannot be understated.  Imperfect 
astrometry or chemistry limits understanding in a number of sub-fields in
astrophysics, including the properties of exoplanet host stars, the formation 
(and destruction) of stars and clusters, as well as the structure of the 
Galactic disk, to name a few.


These formed just some of the scientific drivers for the \gaia\ space telescope.
\gaia\ is primarily an astrometric mission, providing precise positions,
parallaxes and proper motions for more than $10^9$ stars in its final data
release in 2022.  While this is a sample size about three orders of magnitude 
larger than its predecessor \hipparcos, both astrometry and chemistry are 
required to fully characterize the formation and evolution of our Galaxy. 
\gaia\ will also provide radial velocities, stellar parameters and chemical 
abundances for a subset of brighter stars, but these measurements will not be 
available in the first few data releases. Until those abundances are available,
astronomers seeking to use chemistry and kinematic measurements are reliant on 
ground-based spectroscopic surveys in order to complement the available astrometry.


The first \project{Gaia} data release will include positions, proper motions, and 
parallaxes for approximately two million stars in the Tycho-2 \citep{Hog_2000} 
catalog \citep{Michalik_2015a,Michalik_2015b}.  After cross-matching all major 
stellar spectroscopic surveys\footnote{Specifically we cross-matched the Tycho-2
catalog against the \apogee\ \citep{Zasowski_2013}, \ges\
\citep{Gilmore_2012,Randich_2013}, \galah\ \citep{DeSilva_2015},
\lamost\ \citep{Cui_2012}, and \rave\ \citep{Steinmetz_2006} 
surveys}, we found the RAdial Velocity Experiment (hereafter \rave) survey to 
have the largest overlap with the first \gaia\ data release: 292,036 
stars.  We then used the \gaia\ universe model snapshot \citep{Robin_2012} to 
estimate the precision in parallax and proper motions that will be available in 
the first \gaia\ data release (DR1) for stars in those overlap samples. Comparing
the expected precision to what is currently available, we further found that the
\rave\ survey will benefit most from \gaia\ DR1.  The distances of 63\% of the 
\rave--\gaia\ DR1 overlap sample (182,862 stars) are expected to improve with 
the first \gaia\ data release, and 47\% of stars are likely to have better 
proper motions (137,211 stars).  This motivated us to examine what chemical 
abundances were available for \rave, and to evaluate whether we could enable new 
chemodynamic studies by contributing to this existing set of chemical abundances.


We briefly describe the \rave\ data in Section~\ref{sec:data}, before explaining
our methods in Section~\ref{sec:method}.  In Section~\ref{sec:validation}
we outline a number of validation experiments, including: internal sanity checks,
comparisons with literature samples, and investigations to ensure our results
are consistent with expectations from astrophysics.  We discuss these results in
Section~\ref{sec:discussion}, and in Section~\ref{sec:conclusion} we provide 
concluding remarks as well as a description of how to access our results electronically.


\section{Data}
\label{sec:data}


\rave\ is a magnitude-limited stellar spectroscopic survey of the (nearby) Milky Way,
principally designed to measure radial velocities for up to $10^6$ stars.
Observations were conducted on the 1.2~m UK Schmidt telescope at the Australian 
Astronomical Observatory\footnote{Formerly the Anglo-Australian Observatory} from 
2003--2013.  A large 5.7~degree field-of-view and robotic fibre positioner 
made for very efficient observing;  spectra for up to 150 targets could be simultaneously
acquired.  When observations concluded in April 2013, a total of \Nspectra\ useful spectra
had been collected of \Nstars\ unique objects. 


The target selection for \rave\ is based on the $I$-band apparent magnitude,
$9 < I < 12$, with a weak $J - K_s > 0.5$ cut near the disk and bulge \citep{Wonjo_2016}.  
The $I$ band was selected because it overlaps with the wavelength range that \rave\ 
operates in:  8410--8795~\AA.  This spectral region is very well-studied.  It is one 
of the key setups used for the ground-based high-resolution \ges\ survey
\citep{Gilmore_2012,Randich_2013}, and the \rave\ resolution and wavelength
coverage is comparable to the Radial Velocity Spectrometer on board the \gaia\
space telescope \citep{Recio-Blanco_2016}.  The region includes the \ion{Ca}{2} 
near infrared triplet lines, strong transitions that are dominated by pressure 
broadening, which are visible even in very low S/N data or metal-poor stars.  
Atomic transitions of light-, $\alpha$-, and Fe-peak elements are also present, 
allowing for detailed chemical abundance studies.


The exposure times for \rave\ observations were optimised to obtain radial 
velocities for as many stars as possible.  Detailed chemical abundances were
always an important science goal of the survey, but this was a secondary objective.  
For this reason the distribution of S/N ratios in \rave\ spectra is considerably 
lower than other stellar spectroscopic surveys where chemical abundances are the 
primary motivation.  The \rave\ spectra have an effective resolution 
$\mathcal{R} \approx 7500$ and the distribution of S/N ratios peaks at 
$\approx$50~per~pixel$^{-1}$.  For comparison, the \galah\ survey 
\citep{DeSilva_2015} --- which was specifically constructed for detailed chemical 
abundance analyses --- includes a wavelength range about 2.5 times larger at 
resolution $\mathcal{R} \approx 28,000$, and yet the \galah\ project still 
targets for S/N $\gtrsim100$.


Despite the relatively low resolution and S/N of the spectra compared to other
surveys, the \rave\ data releases have demonstrated the team's enormous success 
in deriving radial velocities, stellar astrophysical parameters ($\teff$, $\logg$),
as well as individual chemical abundances \citep{Steinmetz_2006,Zwitter_2008,
Siebert_2011,Kordopatis_2013,Kunder_2016}.  In this work we make use of spectra
that has been reprocessed for the fifth \rave\ data release.  These re-processing
steps include: a detailed re-reduction of all the original data frames, with flux
variances propagated at every step; an updated continuum-normalization procedure;
as well as revised determinations of stellar radial velocities and morphological
classifications. At the end of this processing for each survey observation we are 
provided with: rest-frame wavelengths, continuum-normalized fluxes, fractional 
uncertainties in continuum-normalized flux values, as well as relevant metadata.  
We refer the reader to the official fifth data release paper of the \rave\ survey, 
as presented by \citet{Kunder_2016}, for more details of this re-processing.


Given the high-quality of the normalization performed by the \rave\ team, we chose
not to re-normalize the spectra.  Our tests demonstrated that the procedure 
outlined in \citet{Kunder_2016} is sufficient for our analysis procedure. Therefore,
there is a limited number of pre-processing steps that we conducted before our
analysis could begin.  First, we calculated inverse variance arrays from the
fractional uncertainties provided, and then re-sampled the flux and inverse variance
arrays onto a common rest-wavelength map for all stars.  Depending on the fibre 
used and the stellar radial velocity, the range of rest-frame wavelength values
varied for each star.  Given that fluxes were unavailable in the edge pixels for 
most stars, we excluded pixels outside of the rest wavelength range 
$8423.2\,{\rm \AA} \le \lambda \le 8777.6\,{\rm \AA}$.  This corresponds to about
30~pixels excluded on either side of the common wavelength array, leaving us with
945~pixels per spectrum for science.


\section{Method}
\label{sec:method}

We chose to adopt a data-driven model --- rather than a physics-driven model ---
for this analysis.  Specifically we will use an implementation of \thecannon\
\citep{Ness_2015,Ness_2016}.  Although this choice complicated the construction 
of our model (e.g., see Section \ref{sec:the-training-set}), a data-driven model 
makes use of all available information in the spectrum and lowers the S/N ratio 
at which systematic effects begin to dominate.  In other words, a well-constructed
data-driven model will yield more precise labels (e.g., stellar parameters and
chemical abundances) at low S/N ratios than most physics-driven models\footnote{
However, see \citet{Casey_2016a}}.  This is particularly relevant for the 
low-resolution \rave\ data analysed here, because about half of the spectra have
S/N $\lesssim 50$.  


\noindent{}Our work makes the following assumptions about the \rave\ spectra and \thecannon:

\begin{itemize}
\item We will assume that any fibre- and time-dependent variations in spectral
resolution in the \rave\ spectra are negligible.
\item The \rave\ noise variances are approximately correct, independent between
pixels, and normally distributed.
\item We assume that the normalization procedure employed by the \rave\ pipeline
is invariant with respect to the labels, and invariant with respect to the S/N
ratio.
\item We assume that stars with similar labels ($\teff$, $\logg$, and abundances)
have similar spectra.
\item A stellar spectrum is a smooth function of the label values for that star,
and we assume that the function is smooth enough within a sub-space of the labels
(e.g., the giant branch or the main-sequence) that it can be reasonably approximated 
with a low-order polynomial in label space.
\item We have constructed a training set of stars with mean accurate labels.  Note
that we do not assume that \emph{every} label in the training is accurate -- we can
afford to have a small fraction of inaccurate labels (e.g., unambiguous misclassifications
present in the training set).
\item We assume our training set is representative of the test set (the \rave\ survey).
\end{itemize}


We adopt the nomenclature first set out in \citet{Ness_2015}, and extended in 
\citet{Casey_2016b}.  However, one distinction here with \citet{Casey_2016b} is 
that in this work the \emph{labelled} set and the \emph{training} set will be 
the same set.  In \citet{Casey_2016b} two subsets of the labelled set were 
defined: the training set and a distinct validation set.  This allowing us to 
train on the \emph{training set} and then test on the \emph{validation set}.  
However in this work the labelled set is relatively small, about an order of 
magnitude smaller than what was available in \citet{Casey_2016b}, and therefore 
no validation set exists. We will use all labelled set stars in the training 
step and supplement our validation experiments with literature comparisons.  
Thus, throughout this work we will use the terms \emph{labelled set} and 
\emph{training set} interchangeably. 


\subsection{The training set}
\label{sec:the-training-set}


We sought to construct a training set consisting of stars across the main-sequence,
sub-giant, and the red giant branch.  We required stars with precisely measured
effective temperature $\teff$, surface gravity $\logg$, and elemental abundances
of Fe, Mg, Si, Ti, Ca, Al, and Ni.  This proved to be difficult because the magnitude
range of \rave\ does not overlap substantially with high-resolution spectroscopic
surveys.  The fourth internal data release of the \ges\ survey includes 
giant and main-sequence stars, but only 142 overlap with \rave.  The thirteenth data 
release from \sdss\ \citep{sloan_dr13} includes labels for \apogee\ stars on the
giant branch and (uncalibrated values for) the main-sequence, but our tests indicated
that the main-sequence labels suffered from significant systematic effects.  A flat, 
then `up-turning' main-sequence is present, and the metallicity gradient trends in 
the opposite direction with respect to $\logg$ on the main-sequence (i.e., metal-poor
stars incorrectly sit above the isochrones in a classical Hertzsprung-Russell diagram)
If we consider lower-resolution studies as potential training sets, there are 2,369
stars that overlap with \lamost\ --- of which 2,213 have positive S/N ratios in the 
$g$-band (\texttt{snrg}).  However, the labels are expectedly less precise given the
lower resolution, no detailed abundance information is available for main-sequence 
stars\footnote{Abundance information is available for \lamost\ stars from \citet{Ho_2016},
but that sample contains only giant stars}, and similar systematic trends are apparent
in the lower main-sequence.  The \galah\ survey has a good overlap with \rave, but 
results from that sample are not yet precise enough for our purposes.


These constraints forced us to construct a heterogeneous training set.  Given previous
successes in transferring high S/N ratio labels from \apogee\ \citep{Ness_2015,
Ness_2016,Ho_2016,Casey_2016b}, we chose to use the 1,355 stars in the \apogee---\rave\ 
overlap sample for giant star labels in the training set.  Of these, about 900 are 
giants according to \apogee.  From this sample we selected stars to have: metallicity
determinations ([Fe/H] $> -5$); high S/N ratios in both the \apogee\ and \rave\ spectra
($>200$ in \apogee; $>50$ in \rave); and we further required that the \aspcap\ pipeline 
did not report any peculiar flags (\texttt{ASPCAPFLAG = 0}).  These restrictions left 
us with 357 stars along the giant branch, with metallicities ranging from 
$[{\rm Fe/H}] = -1.62$ to 0.32.  Intermediate tests with globular cluster members showed
that the metallicity range of the training set needed to extend below 
$[{\rm Fe/H}] \lesssim -2$ in order for our catalog to be practically useful.
Therefore, as we will describe in more detail below, we supplemented this sample with 
giant stars from the \epic\ catalog \citep{Huber_2016}.


Assembling a training set for the main-sequence and sub-giant branch was more complex.
There are no spectroscopic studies that have a large enough sample size that overlap 
with \rave, and which also cover our required range in stellar parameters 
(e.g., FGKM-type stars).  Moreover, most of the spectroscopic studies we considered 
exhibit a flat lower main-sequence, a systematic consequence of the analysis method 
adopted \citep[e.g., see][for a discussion]{Bensby_2014}.  For these reasons we chose
to make use of the \epic\ catalog \citep{Huber_2016} for the training set labels on
the main-sequence and sub-giant branch.  The \epic\ catalog follows from the successful
\project{Kepler} input catalog \citep{Brown_2011}, and provides probabilistic stellar 
classifications for 138,600 stars in the \project{K2} fields based on the 
astrometric, asteroseismic, photometric, and spectroscopic information available for
every star.  There are 4,611 stars that overlap between \epic\ and \rave.


\epic\ differs from the \project{Kepler} input catalog because \epic\ does not 
benefit from having narrow-band $DDO_{51}$ photometry in order to aid dwarf/giant 
classification.  Despite this limitation the labels in the \epic\ catalog have 
already been shown to be accurate and trustworthy \citep{Huber_2016}.  However, 
when the posteriors are wide (i.e., the quoted confidence intervals are large) 
due to limited information available, it is possible that a star has been 
mis-classified.  This is most prevalent for sub-giants, where \citet{Huber_2016} 
note that $\approx55-70$\% of sub-giants are misclassified as dwarfs.  The 
probability of misclassification is usually quantified in the uncertainties of 
each star; most sub-giants that could be dwarfs have large confidence intervals.  
Therefore, requiring low uncertainties will decrease the total sample size, but 
will remove most misclassifications.  The situation is far more favourable for 
dwarfs and giants.  Only $1-4$\% of giant stars are misclassified as dwarfs, and 
about 7\% of dwarfs are misclassified as giants.  To summarise, the \epic\ labels 
with narrow confidence intervals are usually of high fidelity, and any spurious 
misclassifications would be clearly distinguishable if spectra were available. 


We sought to have a small overlap between our giant and main-sequence star training
sets.  Most of our giant training set is encapsulated within $0 < \logg < 3.5$, 
however there is a sparse sampling of stars reaching to $\logg \approx 4$.  For
the \epic\ main-sequence/sub-giant star training set we required $\logg > 3.5$,
allowing for $\approx0.5$~dex of overlap between the two training sets.  We further
employed the following quality constraints: the upper and lower confidence intervals 
in $\teff$ must be below 150~K; the upper and lower confidence intervals in $\logg$ 
must be less than 0.15~dex; the $S/N$ of the \rave\ spectra must exceed 
30~per~pixel$^{-1}$; and $\teff \leqslant 6750$~K.  Unfortunately these strict constraints
removed most metal-poor stars, which we later found to cause the test labels to have
under-predicted abundances for dwarfs of low metallicity.  For this reason we relaxed
(ignored) those quality constraints for stars in the \epic\ catalog with 
$[{\rm Fe/H}] < -1$.  Of the stars we forcibly included with $[{\rm Fe/H}] < -1$,
none were classified as being sub-giants in \epic, therefore they have a low (7\%)
likelihood of misclassification.  After training a model based on main-sequence and
giant stars (Section \ref{sec:the-model}), we found we could further identify 
misclassifications by leave-one-out cross-validation (iteratively, even).  However,
we chose not to do this because the number of likely misclassifications in the training
set was negligible ($\approx1$\%), and the improvement in main-sequence test set labels
was minimal.  The distilled sample of the \rave--\epic\ overlap catalog contains 583 
stars (of 4,611).


We previously alluded to including giant stars from \epic\ in our training set based 
on \apogee\ labels.  This was principally to ensure an adequate balance of metal-poor
giant stars in the training set.  Without this inclusion, we again found that the
abundances of giant stars would be under-predicted at low metallicity, critically 
affecting any inferences we wish to make with low metallicity stars (e.g., globular
clusters).  The metallicities in the \epic\ catalog come from a variety of spectroscopic
sources, or photometrically-selected when no spectroscopic information is available.
While these heterogeneous metallicities may introduce scaling differences, on balance we
later found that it was more important to include reasonably accurate (albeit imprecise)
metallicities of metal-poor stars in the training set rather than excluding metal-poor
stars entirely.  In Section~\ref{sec:validation} we show that these potential issues
have a negligible impact on the test set labels, and we further show that our abundances
are consistent with high-resolution studies in the literature.


We have constructed a justified training set for stars across the main-sequence, sub-giant,
and red giant branch.  However the lack of overlap between \rave\ and other works have
resulted in a somewhat peculiar situation. Detailed abundances are available from \apogee\
for all giant stars in our sample, but only imprecise metallicities are available from
\epic\ for stars on the main-sequence and the sub-giant branch.  To our knowledge this 
problem has not been addressed with data-driven models in the astrophysics literature.
In the following section we will construct a simplified model that does not include detailed
abundances, before demonstrating how we (1) improve upon the imprecise metallicities for 
main-sequence/sub-giant stars, and (2) translate abundances from the giant branch stars 
to the main-sequence/sub-giant branch sample.


\subsection{The model}
\label{sec:the-model}

\noindent{}The model we adopt is
\begin{eqnarray}\label{eq:model}
y_{jn} & = & \vecv(\ell_n)\cdot\vectheta_j + e_{jn}\quad ,
\end{eqnarray}

\noindent{}where $y_{jn}$ is the pseudo-continuum-normalized flux for star $n$ at wavelength pixel
$j$, $\vecv(\ell_n)$ is the vectorizing function that takes as input the $K$ labels
$\ell_n$ for star $n$ and outputs functions of those labels as a vector of length
$D>K$, $\vectheta_j$ is a vector of length $D$ of parameters influencing the model at
wavelength pixel $j$, and $e_{jn}$ is the residual (noise).  Here we will only consider
vectorizing functions with polynomial expansions (e.g., $\teff^2$, see Section 
\ref{sec:a-simple-model}).  The noise values $e_{jn}$ can be considered to be drawn 
from a Gaussian distribution with zero mean and variance $\sigma_{jn}^2 + s_j^2$, where
$\sigma_{jn}^2$ is the variance in flux $y_{jn}$ and $s_j^2$ describes the excess 
variance at the $j$-th wavelength pixel.  We direct the reader to \citet{Ness_2015} for
a more detailed introduction and justification of \thecannon.


At the training step we fix the $K$-lists of labels for all the training set stars $n$.
At each wavelength pixel $j$, we then calculate the parameters $\vectheta_j$ and $s_j^2$
by optimizing the penalized likelihood function:
\begin{eqnarray}\label{eq:train}
\vectheta_j,s^2_j &\leftarrow& \argmin{\vectheta,s}\left[
    \sum_{n=0}^{N-1} \frac{[y_{jn}-\vecv(\ell_n)\cdot\vectheta]^2}{\sigma^2_{jn}+s^2}
    + \sum_{n=0}^{N-1} \ln(\sigma^2_{jn}+s^2) + \Lambda{}Q(\vectheta)
    \right]
  \quad ,
\end{eqnarray}

\noindent{}where $\Lambda$ is a regularization parameter which we will heuristically set
for each model in later sections, and $Q(\vectheta)$ is a regularizing function that 
encourages $\vectheta$ values to take on zero values without breaking convexity:
\begin{eqnarray}\label{eq:regularization-function}
	Q(\vectheta) = \sum_{d=1}^{D-1} |{\theta_d}| \quad .
\end{eqnarray}

Note that the $d$ subscript here is zero-indexed; the function $Q(\vectheta)$ does not act
on the (first) $\theta_0$ coefficient, as this is a `pivot point' or offset that we do not
expect to diminish with increasing regularization (e.g., see equation 
\ref{eq:vectorizer-three-label-design-matrix}).  In practice equation \ref{eq:train} is 
optimized by fixing $s_j^2 = 0$ to make equation~\ref{eq:train} a convex optimization 
problem, then we optimize for $\vectheta_j$, before solving for $s_j^2$.  


The \emph{test step} is where we fix the parameters $\vectheta_j,s_j^2$ at all wavelength
pixels $j$, and optimize the $K$-list of labels $\ell_m$ for each test set star $m$.  Here
the objective function is:
\begin{eqnarray}\label{eq:test}
  \ell_m &\leftarrow& \argmin{\ell}\left[
    \sum_{j=0}^{J-1} \frac{[y_{jm}-\vecv(\ell)\cdot\vectheta_j]^2}{\sigma_{jm}^2 + s_j^2}
    \right]
  \quad .
\end{eqnarray}

At the test step optimization we store the covariance matrix $\bm{\Sigma}$ for the labels
$\ell$, which provides us with the formal errors on $\ell$.  The formal errors are expected
to be underestimated, and in Section \ref{sec:validation} we judge the veracity of these 
errors through validation experiments.


\subsection{A 3-label model ($\teff$, $\logg$, $\feh$) for all stars}
\label{sec:a-simple-model}

The model we have introduced is generic in the sense that there is no description for how
complex the vectorizing function $\vecv(\ell)$ should be, or how many $K$ labels are used.
Given previous successes using a second-order (quadratic) polynomial model 
\citep{Ness_2015,Ness_2016,Ho_2016,Casey_2016b}, we will first adopt a three-label ($\teff$, $\logg$, [Fe/H]) model for all (giant and main-sequence) stars. Thus, for our first set of

\stub{We trained the model initially with no regularization. Could reproduce general structure of a main-sequence and HRD, but the intricacies of the structure was gone. Model appeared to be too simple.  However we can use this model to identify dwarfs/giants,etc. Rather than go to a very complex model, we opted to use two models: one for the main-sequence and one for the giant branch.}


\subsection{A 3-label model for unevolved stars}
\label{sec:the-ms-model}

We constructed a three-label quadratic model for the main-sequence and sub-giant
stars in the \epic\ training set.  In order to set the regularization hyperparameter
$\Lambda$ for this model, we trained 30 models with different regularization strengths,
spaced evenly in logarithmic steps between $\Lambda = 10^{-3}$ to $\Lambda = 10^{3}$.
We then performed leave-one-out cross-validation for each model.  Specifically, for 
each star in the training set: we removed the star; trained the model; and then 
inferred labels from the removed star as if it was a test object. We also performed 
leave-one-out cross-validation on an unregularized ($\Lambda = 0$) model, which we 
will use as the basis for comparison.  For every model we calculated the bias and
root-mean-square (RMS) deviation between the input labels and those inferred through
cross-validation. 


We show the \emph{percentage difference} in the RMS deviation of the labels with respect
to the unregularized model in Figure \ref{fig:set-ms-model-hyperparameter}.  The upper 
and lower envelope represent the boundaries across all labels, showing that the RMS
decreased in \emph{all} labels with increasing regularization.  We found similar
improvements in the bias values, however these were already minimal in the unregularized
case.  The improvement in RMS reaches a minimum value near $\Lambda = X.XX$, where
we achieve RMS deviations that are about 30\% better than the unregularized model.
Based on this improvement we set $\Lambda = X.XX$ for the three-label main-sequence model.
At this regularization strength, the bias and RMS values found by leave-one-out
cross validation are, respectively: $X$~K and $XX$~K for $\teff$, $X.XX$~dex and $X.XX$~dex
for $\logg$, with $X.XX$~dex and $X.XX$~dex for [Fe/H].


We made no \emph{a priori} judgements on whether a star was likely a giant
or a dwarf star; we inferred labels for all \rave\ spectra using this 
main-sequence model.  The resulting labels for the survey sample are shown
in Figure \ref{fig:hrd-from-individual-models}, where significant structure is 
visible.  The increased density of Solar-type stars is consistent with \rave\
observing stars in the local neighbourhood, and the high number of turnoff
and main-sequence stars relative to the subgiant branch is expected from 
the relative lifetimes of these evolutionary phases.  An overdensity
of stars near the giant branch clump is also present.  This artefact is due 
to having giant stars in the test set, but not in the training set, and the
model is (poorly) extrapolating outside the convex hull of the training set.
In Section \ref{sec:joining-the-models} we describe how results from multiple
models are combined to produce a single catalog.


\subsection{A 9-label model for detailed abundances of giant stars}
\label{sec:giant-abundance-model}


We only have $\teff$, $\logg$, and [Fe/H] for unevolved stars in our training
set from the \epic\ catalog \citep{Huber_2016}.  However, the giant stars 
have stellar parameters ($\teff$, $\logg$) and up to 15 individual abundances
from the \aspcap\ \citep{aspcap_paper}.  A subset of these elements have atomic
transitions in the \rave\ wavelength region: \ion{O}{1}, \ion{Mg}{1}, 
\ion{Al}{1}, \ion{Si}{1}, \ion{Ca}{2}, \ion{Ti}{1}, \ion{Fe}{1}, and \ion{Ni}{1}.  
We excluded [Ti/H] from our abundance list because of systematics in the training
set \citep{Holtzman_2015,Hawkins_2016}.  Therefore we are left with nine labels 
in our giant star model: $\teff$, $\logg$, and seven individual abundances.  


We used a quadratic vectorizer for the giant star model, where the quadratic and
cross-terms are expanded in the same way as \ref{eq:vectorizer-three-label}, only
with nine labels.  The regularization hyperparameter $\Lambda$ was set in the same
way described in Section \ref{sec:ms-model}, using the same 30 trials of $\Lambda$.
The results are shown in Figure \ref{fig:set-giant-model-hyperparameters}, where
again the enveloped region represents the minimum and maximum change in RMS label
deviation with respect to the unregularized case.  At the point of maximum improvement 
near $\Lambda = X.XX$, the RMS in all nine labels has decreased by at least $X$\%, 
and up to $X$\%.  Here the regularization strength also produces a sparser matrix
of $\vectheta$, with a $\approx20$\% increase in the fraction of zero-valued 
entries, particularly for the cross-terms (Figure \ref{fig:giant-model-sparsity},
third panel).  Based on the increased model sparsity and decreasing RMS deviation
in the labels, we adopt $\Lambda = X.XX$ for our giant star model.


Results from cross-validation on our regularized model imply that the precision
in labels is XXX~K in $\teff$, X.XX~dex in $\logg$, and X.XX~dex (EL) and 
X.XX~dex (EL) depending on the elemental abundance.  We inferred labels for all
XXX,XXX \rave\ spectra using this model, and these results are summarized in
Figure \ref{fig:test-set-hrd} (middle panel).  The red clump is clearly visible
and in the expected location, without requiring any post-analysis calibration.
Artefacts due to dwarf stars in the test set are also present.


\subsection{Joining the models}
\label{sec:joining-the-models}

% All them hax used to combine all the results.

% --> Chi-sq of the sample.
% --> Convex hull? Distance to plane?


\section{Validation experiments}
\label{sec:validation}

In addition to the cross-validation tests that we have previously described, 
we conducted a number of internal and external validation experiments to 
test the validity of our results.

\subsection{Multi-epoch observations}
\label{sec:repeat-observations}

The \rave\ survey performed repeat observations for 43,918 stars with time 
intervals ranging from a few hours to up to four years.  This timing was 
constructed to be quasi-logarithmic such that spectroscopic binaries could
be optimally identified. Most of the stars that were observed multiple times
were only observed twice, with thirteen visits being the maximum number 
of observations for any target.  These repeat observations allow us to 
quantify the level of (in)correctness in our formal errors.  For every star
with multiple visits we constructed a high S/N stacked spectrum for that
star, weighted by the inverse variances in the individual visit spectra.


We treated the stacked spectra as normal survey stars.  We inferred labels
using all models and joined the results as per Section \ref{sec:joining-the-models}.  The labels inferred from the stacked spectra served as the basis
of comparison for all individual visits to that object.  Figure 
\ref{fig:formal-errors-comparison} shows the difference in labels 
between the comparison spectrum and a repeat visit, normalized by their 
formal errors summed in quadrature (e.g., 
$\Delta\logg/\sqrt{\sigma_{\logg,stacked}^2 + \sigma_{\logg,visit}^2}$).
If our measurements were unbiased by S/N and the formal errors were 
representative, these values should be normally distributed with a zero 
mean and unit variance.
\stub{Are they? (Probably). How much should we inflate our formal errors, and should this be as a function of S/N? Note that in all Figures and tables,
we show these inflated errors only, as we gauge them to be more representative.}

\stub{Covariances between these parameters are accessible through the matrix of correlation coefficients in the associated results file.}


\subsection{Jackknifing the training set}
\label{sec:jackknife}

\stub{Should we?}

\subsection{Quality control}
\stub{What should we adopt as recommended QC? Show rogue gallery of a few "high s/n cases" where things went haywire?}


\subsection{External validation}
\label{sec:external-validation}

Here we cross-match our results against literature samples to verify that
our labels are accurate.  Because this work is an independent analysis, our
first point of reference is against the official \rave\ data releases.  These
comparisons are shown in Figures \ref{fig:rave-dr4-comparison} and 
\ref{fig:rave-dr5-comparison}, where we show our labels with respect to the
results in the fourth and fifth \rave\ data releases, respectively.  In order
to provide a fair comparison, we only show stars that meet a number of quality
flags in both samples. 
\stub{What selections qualify as a fair comparison in both samples?}
There is very good agreement in $\teff$, with a bias
and RMS of just XX~K and XXX~K, respectively.  We find our $\logg$ values are
closest to the `calibrated' \rave\ surface gravities, which make use of 
asteroseismic information to correct (increase) the $\logg$ values along the
giant branch.  The calibrated \rave\ surface gravities also correct the 
location of the red clump (by $\sim0.5$~dex) to be in the same position in our
results.  However, while our $\logg$ values generally agree with the calibrated
\rave\ values along the giant branch, our $\logg$ values do differ slightly 
along the main-sequence.  This is principally because the main-sequence in 
this work tends to taper down towards higher $\logg$ values at cooler 
temperatures, whereas the comparison sample tend to have a slightly flatter
main-sequence.  This difference is not likely to have a very significant 
effect on the detailed abundance or spectrophotometric distance determinations
between these studies.

\stub{Discuss comparisons with: GES; calibration sources used in \citet{Kordopatis_2013}; and `gold-standard' studies: Reddy, Bensby, Valenti \& Fischer}

\stub{Any differences in RAVE abundances? Corrections required due to having an unbalanced training set? Any caution required?}


\subsection{Astrophysical validation}
\label{sec:astrophysical-validation}


After verifying that our stellar labels are comparable with other
high-resolution studies, here we verify that the abundance labels we find
are consistent with expectations from astrophysics.  One example is stars in
globular clusters, which show anti-correlations in light element abundances 
\citep[e.g.,][and references therein]{Da_Costa,Carretta_2009}. In the \rave\
survey, \cite{Anguiano_2015} found 70 stars with positions and radial velocities that are
consistent with being members of globular clusters.  We have used that sample
Specifically, this GC sample includes 49 stars belonging to NGC~5139 ($\omega$~Centauri), 11 members of the retrograde
globular cluster NGC~3201, and 10 members of NGC~362.  
All of these systems are well-studied and exhibit abundance anti-correlations 
in Na--O and Mg--Al \citep{people}.  Other correlations are also present 
(e.g., C--N), but those relationships are less relevant for this work because 
we do not measure C and N abundances here.  We note that \emph{none} of these 
cluster stars are present in our training set.


We show the detailed abundances for these globular cluster members in
Figure \ref{fig:globular-cluster-abundances}.  For comparison purposes we
have included abundances from the high-resolution studies of \citep{people}.
\stub{What do we find?}

% Assuming we recover these relationships...
Indeed, this demonstrates that our abundance labels can be used to identify
globular cluster members that are now tidally disrupted \citep{Anguiano_2016,Kuzma_2016,Navin_2016},
even for stars with low S/N ratios.

% Some literature notes:
% See http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0004-637X/731/1/64/pdf
% NGC 3201 has Na-O anti-correlation: Carretta et al. (2009)
% NGC 362 has "two discrete groups along the Na-O anti-correlation": https://arxiv.org/abs/1307.4085
% NGC 362 has Mg-Al relationship (low Mg scatter, large Al scatter) --> Carretta (2013)
% NGC 362 has a large metallicity spread in RAVE (Anguiano_2015) but not the case in high-res studies (e.g. https://arxiv.org/abs/1307.4085 has a metallicity spread of 0.05/0.08 dex) may indicate better cluster selection needed and can be done with cannon results.
% NGC 3201 has Mg-Al relationship (http://arxiv.org/pdf/1305.3645.pdf and references therein)

\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:discussion}


\stub{Chemistry + Kinematics = Stockholm}

\stub{What do the two provide us with?}

\stub{What is one interesting science result should we show based on these abundances and Hipparcos results, which was not known previously?}


\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

% We have introduced a non-parametric version of The Cannon that uses strict priors on line formation (censoring masks), and prior probability distributions on astrophysical parameters, using isochrones.
% We ran it on the entire RAVE spectra.
% We deliver effective temperature, surface gravity, and abundances of up to 8 elements for \Nstars.  Our internal and external validation tests suggest that we achieve a typical precision of X~K in $\teff$, 0.0X~dex in $\logg$, and $\approx{}X.XX$ in individual chemical abundances.  This catalog constitutes the largest collection of stellar abundances for stars in the first \project{Gaia} data release.  When combined with positions and 3D velocities from \project{Gaia}, the \project{UNRAVE} catalog will likely be crucial for understanding our local place in the Milky Way.
