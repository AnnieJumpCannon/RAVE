\begin{abstract}
On 14 September 2016 the \project{Gaia} mission will release positions, proper 
motions, and parallaxes for about two million stars.  Most studies intending to
make use of those data would benefit enormously by coupling that astrometry with
stellar chemical abundances.  The RAdial Velocity Experiment (\project{RAVE}) 
survey has acquired spectra for approximately 290,000 stars in common with the 
first \project{Gaia} data release, constituting the largest overlap of any 
stellar spectroscopic sample.  Here we perform an independent analysis of the 
\project{RAVE} spectra using a new non-parametric implementation of \thecannon\ 
that employs prior probabilities on atomic line formation and stellar 
astrophysical parameters.  We deliver effective temperature $\teff$, surface 
gravity $\logg$, and chemical abundances of up to seven elements (Mg, Al, Si, 
Ca, Ti, Fe, Ni) for \Nstars\ stars.  We validate our results internally from 
repeat visits, and externally against existing high-resolution spectroscopic 
surveys.  The typical precision in chemical abundances is X.XX~dex.

\section{Introduction} 
\label{sec:introduction}

The Milky Way is considered to be the best laboratory for understanding galaxy formation and evolution.  This premise depends on the ability to precisely measure the position, motion, and chemistry of (many) individual stars, and to infer the structure, kinematics, and chemical enrichment of the Galaxy from those data \citep[e.g.,][]{Deason_2011,Ness_2012,Ness_2013a,Ness_2013b,Casey_2012,Casey_2013,Casey_2014a,Casey_2014b}.  % include references on: disk chemistry, halo structures
However, these quantities are not known for even 1\% of stars in the Milky Way.  Stellar distances are famously imprecise \citep[e.g.,][]{van_Leeuwen_2007,Jofre_2015,Madler_2016}, proper motions are frequently plagued by unquantified systematics from the first epoch observations \citep[e.g.,][]{Casey_Schlaufman_2015}, and stellar spectroscopists frequently report significantly different chemical abundance patterns \citep{Smiljanic_2014}.  If these measurements were known with high fidelity then \stub{xyz}.


% These scientific questions were only some of them that prompted Gaia.
% What will Gaia provide eventually.
% In the first data release what do we get.
% While this is an order of magnitude better than Hipparcos, if we want to use these data to understand the chemical evolution of the galaxy then we need additional information.
% until abundances are available from gaia RVS, we rely on ground-based spectroscopic surveys to provide the chemistry



% Gaia will produce a very clear snapshot, producing astrometry space motions

% but if we want to infer the past then we need additional information about how the galaxy has been enriched. so we need chemical abundances.
% the number of stars that overlap with Gaia DR1 between stellar surveys is very different, due to targeting, etc
% and those stars are not on the same metallicity scale
% therefore a large-scale catalog of homogenous abundances that overlap with Gaia DR1 is currently lacking



\stub{Chemistry and kinematics are essential for unfolding the Galaxy, etc.}

\stub{
Gaia will do this, and until Gaia releases abundances for stars from RVS 
spectra, we rely on ground-based surveys to provide chemical abundances.
This includes GES, APOGEE, etc.
}

The first \project{Gaia} data release includes positions, proper motions, and 
parallaxes for approximately two million stars in the Tycho-2 catalog \citep{Hog_2000}.  
After cross-matching all major stellar spectroscopic surveys\footnote{Specifically 
we cross-matched the Tycho-2 catalog against {APOGEE} \citep{Zasowski_2013}, 
\project{GALAH} \citep{DeSilva_2015}, \project{Gaia-ESO} \citep{Gilmore_2012,Randich_2013}, \project{LAMOST}
\citep{Cui_2012}, and \project{RAVE} \citep{Steinmetz_2006}}, we found the RAdial Velocity
Experiment (hereafter \rave) 
survey to have the largest overlap with the first \project{Gaia} data release: 
292,036 stars.  We then used the \project{Gaia} universe model \citep{Robin_2012} to 
estimate the precision in parallax and proper motions that will be available in 
\project{Gaia} DR1 for every star in these cross-matches.  Comparing the 
expected precision to what is currently available, we further found that the 
\project{RAVE} survey will benefit most from \project{Gaia} DR1.  The distances
of 63\% of the \project{RAVE}--\project{Gaia} DR1 overlap sample (182,862 stars)
are expected to improve with the first \project{Gaia} data release, and 47\% of
stars likely to have better proper motions (137,211 stars).  This motivated us to
examine what chemical abundance information is currently available for \rave, and
to evaluate whether we could contribute to this existing set.


We briefly describe the \rave\ data in Section \ref{sec:data}, before explaining
the model we employ in Section \ref{sec:model}.  In Section \ref{sec:validation}
we outline a number of validation experiments, including: internal sanity checks,
comparisons with literature samples, and investigations to ensure our results
are consistent with expectations from astrophysics.  We provide concluding
remarks in Section \ref{sec:conclusion}, as well as a description of how to
access the data.


\section{Data}
\label{sec:data}

The \rave\ survey started observations using the 6dF system on the 1.2~m UK 
Schmidt telescope at the Australian Astronomical Observatory\footnote{Formerly 
the Anglo-Australian Observatory}.  The large 5.7~degree field-of-view and 
robotic fibre positioner made for very efficient observing: up to 150 targets 
could be simultaneously obtained.  When observations concluded in April 2013, a 
total of 574,630 spectra had been collected of 483,330 unique objects.


RAVE is a magnitude-limited survey, targeting stars with apparent $I$-band
magnitudes between $9 < I < 13$.  The $I$ band was used as the selection
magnitude because it overlaps with the wavelength range that \rave\ operates in:
8410--8795~\AA.  This setup includes the \ion{Ca}{2} near-infrared triplet,
strong stellar absorption lines that are visible even in very low S/N data 
(i.e., they are very useful for radial velocity determination).  


As the name implies, the \rave\ survey was principally designed to obtain radial
velocity measurements.  Detailed chemical abundances were a secondary science 
goal of the survey.  For this reason the distribution of S/N ratios for \rave\ 
spectra is considerably lower than stellar spectroscopic surveys where chemical
abundances are the defining objective.  The 
\rave\ spectra cover $\approx38$~nm in the infrared with an effective resolution
$\mathcal{R} \approx 7500$, and the S/N peaks at $\approx$50~per~pixel$^{-1}$.
For comparison, the \project{GALAH} survey \citep{DeSilva_2015} --- which was 
specifically constructed for detailed chemical abundance analyses --- includes a
wavelength range about 2.5 times larger at resolution $\mathcal{R} \approx 28,000$,
and target for S/N $\gtrsim100$.


Despite the relatively low resolution and S/N of the spectra, the \rave\ data
releases have demonstrated the team's enormous success in deriving radial 
velocities, stellar astrophysical parameters ($\teff$, $\logg$), as well as 
individual chemical abundances \citep{Steinmetz_2006,Zwitter_2008,Siebert_2011,
Kordopatis_2013, Kunder_2016}.  The data used for this analysis are the result
of a thorough reprocessing of all survey data.  This includes a detailed
re-reduction of the original data frames, an updated continuum-normalization
procedure, as well as an improvement on the quantification of flux errors in
each pixel.  At the end of this processing for each survey observation we are 
provided with: wavelengths, continuum-normalized fluxes, as well as 
$1\sigma$ uncertainties in flux values.  We refer the reader to the official 
fifth data release paper of the \rave\ survey, as presented by
\citet{Kunder_2016}, for more details of this reprocessing.


We chose not to re-normalize the spectra, as our tests proved to us that the
normalization procedure outlined in \citet{Kunder_2016} is sufficient for our
analysis.  We re-sampled all spectra onto a common rest-wavelength map.
Depending on the fibre used and stellar radial velocity, the rest-frame wavelength
range varied for each star.  Given that fluxes were unavailable in the edge
pixels for most stars, we excluded pixels outside of the rest wavelength range
$8423.2\,{\rm \AA} \le \lambda \le 8777.6\,{\rm \AA}$.


\section{Model}
\label{sec:model}

Given the relatively low S/N ratios in the \rave\ spectra, we chose to adopt a 
data-driven model (rather than a physics-driven model) for this analysis.

% Identify outliers.
% Convex hull? Distance to plane?

% Stars with morphological classification

% Internal validation:
% --> repeat visits: are our formal errors reasonable?
% --> bootstrap resampling of the training set?

% External validation: 
% --> RAVE Data Release 4
% --> Gaia-ESO Survey
% --> APOGEE / EPIC (whichever was not used)
% --> Literature studies presented in Kordopatis+ 2014

% Astrophysical validation:
% --> Identify open clusters and look at their metallicity spreads
% --> Identify globular clusters and look to see whether we capture "expected" abundance trends/spreads that are seen elsewhere in the literature
% --> Residuals as a function of galactic position? (DIBS)

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

% We have introduced a non-parametric version of The Cannon that uses strict priors on line formation (censoring masks), and prior probability distributions on astrophysical parameters, using isochrones.
% We ran it on the entire RAVE spectra.
% We deliver effective temperature, surface gravity, and abundances of up to 8 elements for \Nstars.  Our internal and external validation tests suggest that we achieve a typical precision of X~K in $\teff$, 0.0X~dex in $\logg$, and $\approx{}X.XX$ in individual chemical abundances.  This catalog constitutes the largest collection of stellar abundances for stars in the first \project{Gaia} data release.  When combined with positions and 3D velocities from \project{Gaia}, the \project{UNRAVE} catalog will likely be crucial for understanding our local place in the Milky Way.
