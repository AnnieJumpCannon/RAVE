\begin{abstract}
On 14 September 2016 the \project{Gaia} mission will release positions, proper motions, and parallaxes for about two million stars.  Most studies intending to make use of those data would benefit enormously from stellar chemical abundances.  The RAdial Velocity Experiment (\project{RAVE}) survey has acquired spectra for approximately 290,000 stars in common with the first \project{Gaia} data release, constituting the largest overlap of any stellar spectroscopic sample.  Here we perform an independent analysis of the \project{RAVE} spectra using a new non-parametric implementation of \thecannon\ that employs prior probabilities on atomic line formation and stellar astrophysical parameters.  We deliver effective temperature $\teff$, surface gravity $\logg$, and chemical abundances of up to seven elements (Mg, Al, Si, Ca, Ti, Fe, Ni) for \Nstars\ stars.  We validate our results internally from repeat visits, and externally against existing high-resolution spectroscopic surveys.  The typical precision in chemical abundances is $X.XX$~dex.

\section{Introduction} 
\label{sec:introduction}

% Chemistry and kinematics are essential for unfolding the Galaxy.

% Gaia will do this, and until Gaia releases abundances for stars from RVS spectra, we rely on ground-based surveys to provide chemical abundances.
% This includes GES, APOGEE, etc.


\section{Data}
\label{sec:data}

The first \project{Gaia} data release includes positions, proper motions, and parallaxes for approximately two million stars in the Tycho-2 catalog \citep{tycho2}.  After cross-matching all major stellar spectroscopic surveys\footnote{Specifically we cross-matched the Tycho-2 catalog against {APOGEE} \citep{apogee}, \project{GALAH} \citep{galah}, \project{Gaia-ESO} \citep{ges}, \project{LAMOST} \citep{lamost}, and \project{RAVE} \citep{rave}}, we found the \project{RAVE} survey to have the largest overlap with the first \project{Gaia} data release: 292,036 stars.  We then used the \project{Gaia} universe model to estimate the precision in parallax and proper motions available in \project{Gaia} DR1 for every star in these cross-matches.  Comparing the expected precision to what is currently available, we further found that the \project{RAVE} survey would benefit most from \project{Gaia} DR1.  The distances of 63\% of the \project{RAVE}--\project{Gaia} DR1 overlap sample (182,862 stars) are expected to improve with the first \project{Gaia} data release, and 47\% are likely to have better proper motions (137,211 stars).


This motivated us to examine what chemical abundance information is currently available for \project{RAVE}, and to evaluate whether we could contribute additional abundances.




% We examined the overlap between different surveys and found RAVE to have the largest overlap with Gaia DR1.
% RAVE observed from X to Y, given blah blah blah resolution, etc
% RAVE was a radial velocity survey, so the S/N peaks at ~40
% Typically lower than the requisite S/N ratio required for chemical abundances.



% How many spectra, acquired over what time
% Data reduction
% Normalization
% Flux errors.

\section{Methods}
\label{sec:methods}

% Describe The Cannon briefly
% Initial tests using a single model for all RAVE spectra
% Complex structure led us to ivnestigate other models.
% Non-parametric form
% Censoring masks
% Priors on astrophysical parameters from isochrones

% Include velocities at test time?
% Train on fibre number? Fit for spectral resolution at test time?

\section{Validation}
\label{sec:validation}

% Chi-sq of the sample.
% Identify outliers.
% Stars with morphological classification

% Internal validation:
% --> repeat visits: are our formal errors reasonable?
% --> bootstrap resampling of the training set?

% External validation: 
% --> RAVE Data Release 4
% --> Gaia-ESO Survey
% --> Asteroseismic nu_max and delta_nu available anywhere?
% --> Furhman and other studies in Kordopatis+ 2014

% Astrophysical validation:
% --> Identify open clusters and look at their metallicity spreads
% --> Identify globular clusters and look to see whether we capture "expected" abundance trends/spreads that are seen elsewhere in the literature
% --> Residuals as a function of galactic position? (DIBS)

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

% We have introduced a non-parametric version of The Cannon that uses strict priors on line formation (censoring masks), and prior probability distributions on astrophysical parameters, using isochrones.
% We ran it on the entire RAVE spectra.
% We deliver effective temperature, surface gravity, and abundances of up to 8 elements for \Nstars.  Our internal and external validation tests suggest that we achieve a typical precision of X~K in $\teff$, 0.0X~dex in $\logg$, and $\approx{}X.XX$ in individual chemical abundances.  This catalog constitutes the largest collection of stellar abundances for stars in the first \project{Gaia} data release.  When combined with positions and 3D velocities from \project{Gaia}, the \project{UNRAVE} catalog will likely be crucial for understanding our local place in the Milky Way.
