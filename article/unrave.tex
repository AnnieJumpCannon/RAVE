\begin{abstract}
On 14 September 2016 the \project{Gaia} mission will release positions, proper 
motions, and parallaxes for about two million stars.  Most studies intending to
make use of those data would benefit enormously by coupling that astrometry with
stellar chemical abundances.  The RAdial Velocity Experiment (\project{RAVE}) 
survey has acquired spectra for 292,036 stars in common with the 
first \project{Gaia} data release, constituting the largest overlap of any 
stellar spectroscopic sample.  Here we perform an independent analysis of the 
\project{RAVE} spectra using an implementation of \thecannon\ 
that uses prior probabilities on atomic line formation and stellar 
astrophysical parameters.  We deliver effective temperature $\teff$, surface 
gravity $\logg$, and chemical abundances of up to seven elements (Mg, Al, Si, 
Ca, Ti, Fe, Ni) for \Nstars\ stars.  We validate our results internally from 
repeat visits, and externally against existing high-resolution spectroscopic 
surveys.  The typical precision in chemical abundances is X.XX~dex.  
We provide improved distances by isochrone-fitting for \project{RAVE} stars
where astrometric solutions are not available in the first \project{Gaia}
data release.

\section{Introduction} 
\label{sec:introduction}

The Milky Way is considered to be the best laboratory for understanding galaxy
formation and evolution.  This premise hinges on the ability to precisely measure 
the position, motion, and chemistry of (many) individual stars, and use those data 
to infer the structure, kinematics, and chemical enrichment of the Galaxy 
\citep[e.g.,][]{Deason_2011,Ness_2012,Ness_2013a,Ness_2013b,Casey_2012,Casey_2013,
Casey_2014a,Casey_2014b}.  % include references on: disk chemistry, halo structures
However, these quantities are not known for even 1\% of stars in the Milky Way.  
Stellar distances are famously imprecise \citep[e.g.,][]{van_Leeuwen_2007,
Jofre_2015,Madler_2016}, proper motions can be plagued by unquantified systematics
from the first epoch observations \citep[e.g.,][]{Casey_Schlaufman_2015}, and 
stellar spectroscopists frequently report significantly different chemical 
abundance patterns \citep{Smiljanic_2014}.  Countless long-standing astrophysics
problems could be resolved if those measurements were known with high fidelity: 
\stub{x? \citep{someone}; y; and z, to list just a few}.


\stub{Introducing Gaia; rely on ground-based spectroscopic surveys for chemistry}
% Introducing Gaia
% Gaia will produce a very clear snapshot, producing astrometry space motions
% What will Gaia provide eventually.
% In the first data release what do we get.
% While this is an order of magnitude better than Hipparcos, if we want to use these data to understand the chemical evolution of the galaxy then we need additional information.
% until abundances are available from gaia RVS, we rely on ground-based spectroscopic surveys to provide the chemistry

The first \project{Gaia} data release will include positions, proper motions, and 
parallaxes for approximately two million stars in the Tycho-2 \citep{Hog_2000} 
catalog \citep{Michalik_2015a,Michalik_2015b}.  After cross-matching all major 
stellar spectroscopic surveys\footnote{Specifically we cross-matched the Tycho-2
catalog against the \project{APOGEE} \citep{Zasowski_2013}, \project{Gaia-ESO} 
\citep{Gilmore_2012,Randich_2013}, \project{GALAH} \citep{DeSilva_2015},
\project{LAMOST} \citep{Cui_2012}, and \project{RAVE} \citep{Steinmetz_2006} 
surveys}, we found the RAdial Velocity Experiment (hereafter \rave) survey to 
have the largest overlap with the first \project{Gaia} data release: 292,036 
stars.  We then used the \project{Gaia} universe model \citep{Robin_2012} to 
estimate the precision in parallax and proper motions that will be available in 
\project{Gaia} DR1 for every star in these cross-matches.  Comparing the expected
precision to what is currently available, we further found that the \project{RAVE}
survey will benefit most from \project{Gaia} DR1.  The distances of 63\% of the 
\project{RAVE}--\project{Gaia} DR1 overlap sample (182,862 stars) are expected to
improve with the first \project{Gaia} data release, and 47\% of stars likely to
have better proper motions (137,211 stars).  This motivated us to examine what 
chemical abundance information was available for \rave, and to evaluate whether 
we could enable new chemodynamic studies by contributing to this existing set of
chemical abundances.


We briefly describe the \rave\ data in section \ref{sec:data}, before explaining
the model we employ in section \ref{sec:model}.  In section \ref{sec:validation}
we outline a number of validation experiments, including: internal sanity checks,
comparisons with literature samples, and investigations to ensure our results
are consistent with expectations from astrophysics.  We provide concluding
remarks in section \ref{sec:conclusion}, as well as a description of how to
access our results electronically.


\section{Data}
\label{sec:data}


\rave\ is a magnitude-limited stellar spectroscopic survey of the (nearby) Milky Way,
principally designed to measure radial velocities for up to $10^6$ stars.
Observations were conducted on the 1.2~m UK Schmidt telescope at the Australian 
Astronomical Observatory\footnote{Formerly the Anglo-Australian Observatory} from 
2003--2013.  The large 5.7~degree field-of-view and robotic fibre positioner (6dF)
made for very efficient observing: spectra for up to 150 targets could be 
simultaneously acquired.  When observations concluded in April 2013, a total of 
574,630 spectra had been collected of 483,330 unique objects. 


The target selection for \rave\ is based on the $I$-band apparent magnitude,
$9 < I < 12$, with a weak $J - K_s > 0.5$ cut near the disk and bulge\footnote{
However, see the works of \citet{Kunder_2016} and \citet{Kordopatis_2013} for 
subtleties of the selection function}.
The $I$ band was used because it overlaps with the wavelength range 
that \rave\ operates in:  8410--8795~\AA.  This setup includes the \ion{Ca}{2} 
near-infrared triplet.  These stellar absorption lines are dominated by pressure 
broadening, which makes them strong and therefore visible even in very low S/N data
or metal-poor stars.  This spectral region is also well-studied.  It is one of the
key setups used for the ground-based high-resolution \project{Gaia-ESO} survey
\citep{Gilmore_2012,Randich_2013}, and the \rave\ resolution and wavelength
coverage is comparable to the Radial Velocity Spectrometer on board the \project{Gaia}
space telescope \citep{Recio-Blanco_2016}.


The exposure times for \rave\ observations were optimised to obtain radial 
velocities for as many stars as possible.  Detailed chemical abundances were
always an important science goal of the survey, but this was a secondary objective.  
For this reason the distribution of S/N ratios in \rave\ spectra is considerably 
lower than other stellar spectroscopic surveys where chemical abundances are the 
primary motivation.  The \rave\ spectra have an effective resolution 
$\mathcal{R} \approx 7500$ and the distribution of S/N ratios peaks at 
$\approx$50~per~pixel$^{-1}$.  For comparison, the \project{GALAH} survey 
\citep{DeSilva_2015} --- which was specifically constructed for detailed chemical 
abundance analyses --- includes a wavelength range about 2.5 times larger at 
resolution $\mathcal{R} \approx 28,000$, and yet the \project{GALAH} project still 
targets for S/N $\gtrsim100$.


Despite the relatively low resolution and S/N of the spectra compared to other
surveys, the \rave\ data releases have demonstrated the team's enormous success 
in deriving radial velocities, stellar astrophysical parameters ($\teff$, $\logg$),
as well as individual chemical abundances \citep{Steinmetz_2006,Zwitter_2008,
Siebert_2011,Kordopatis_2013, Kunder_2016}.  In this work we make use of spectra
that has been reprocessed for the fifth \rave\ data release.  These re-processing
steps include: a detailed re-reduction of all the original data frames, with flux
variances propagated at every step; an updated continuum-normalization procedure;
as well as revised determinations of stellar radial velocities and morphological
classifications. At the end of this processing for each survey observation we are 
provided with: rest-frame wavelengths, continuum-normalized fluxes, fractional 
uncertainties in continuum-normalized flux values, as well as relevant metadata.  
We refer the reader to the official fifth data release paper of the \rave\ survey, 
as presented by \citet{Kunder_2016}, for more details of this re-processing.


Given the high-quality of the normalization performed by the \rave\ team, we chose
not to re-normalize the spectra.  Our tests demonstrated that the procedure 
outlined in \citet{Kunder_2016} is sufficient for our analysis procedure. Therefore,
there is a limited number of pre-processing steps that we conducted before our
analysis could begin.  Firstly, we calculated inverse variance arrays from the
fractional uncertainties provided, then re-sampled the flux and inverse variance
arrays onto a common rest-wavelength map for all stars.  Depending on the fibre 
used and the stellar radial velocity, the range of rest-frame wavelength values
varied for each star.  Given that fluxes were unavailable in the edge pixels for 
most stars, we excluded pixels outside of the rest wavelength range 
$8423.2\,{\rm \AA} \le \lambda \le 8777.6\,{\rm \AA}$.  This corresponds to about
30~pixels excluded on either side of the common wavelength array.


\section{Model}
\label{sec:model}


Given the relatively low S/N ratios in the \rave\ spectra, we chose to adopt a 
data-driven model (rather than a physics-driven model) for this analysis.

\stub{data-driven goodness}
% Describe The Cannon briefly, refer to Ness.


\subsection{The training set}
\label{sec:the-training-set}

We sought to construct a training set consisting of stars across the main-sequence,
sub-giant, and the red giant branch.  We require stars with precisely measured
effective temperature $\teff$, surface gravity $\logg$, and elemental abundances
of Fe, Mg, Si, Ti, Ca, Al, and Ni.  This proved to be difficult because the magnitude
range of \rave\ does not overlap substantially with high-resolution spectroscopic
surveys.  The fourth data release of the \project{Gaia-ESO} survey includes giant
and main-sequence stars, but only 142 overlap with \rave.  The most recent 
\project{APOGEE} data release \citep{apogee_dr13} reports labels for stars on the
giant branch and (uncalibrated values for) the main-sequence, but our tests indicated
that the main-sequence labels suffered from unexpected systematic effects.  A flat, 
then `up-turning' main-sequence is present, and the metallicity gradient trends in 
the opposite direction with respect to $\logg$ on the main-sequence (i.e., metal-poor
stars sit above the isochrones, not below).  If we move to lower-resolution studies,
there are 2,369 stars that overlap with \project{LAMOST} --- of which 2,213 have positive
S/N ratios in the $g$-band (\texttt{snrg}).  However, similar systematic effects are 
seen in the main-sequence, the labels are expectedly less precise given the lower
resolution, no detailed abundance information is available\footnote{Abundance 
information is available for \project{LAMOST} stars from \citet{Ho_2015}, but that 
sample contains only giant stars}, and there is only sparse sampling across the 
Hertsprung-Russell diagram.  The \project{GALAH} survey has a good overlap with \rave,
but results from that sample are not yet precise enough for our purposes.

\section{Validation experiments}
\label{sec:validation}


\subsection{Internal validation}
We first conducted leave-one-out cross-validation to validate our results.
For each training set star we removed that star from the training set and
then re-trained the model.  Using that re-trained model, we then treated
the excluded star as a test star and compared our inferred labels to the
test set labels.  We show the results of this experiment in Figure
\ref{fig:loocv-comparison}.  The bias and root mean square (RMS) error in 
$\teff$ is XX~K and XX~K, and in $\logg$ is X.XX~dex and X.XX~dex,
respectively.  The bias in abundance labels is negligible --- between
X.XX to X.XX --- and the RMS varies from X.XX ([XX/H]) to X.XX ([XX/H]).


The \rave\ survey performed repeat observations for 23,288 stars  with time 
intervals ranging from a few hours to up to four years.  This timing was 
constructed to be quasi-logarithmic such that spectroscopic binaries could
be optimally identified. Most of the stars that were observed multiple times
were only observed twice, with thirteen visits being the maximum number 
of observations for any target.  These repeat observations allow us to 
quantify the level of (in)correctness in our formal errors.  For every star
with multiple visits we constructed a high S/N stacked spectrum for that
star, weighted by the inverse variances in the individual visit spectra,
which then served as the basis of comparison to all individual visits.  
Figure \ref{fig:formal-errors-comparison} shows the difference in labels 
between the comparison spectrum and a repeat visit, normalized by their 
formal errors summed in quadrature (e.g., $\Delta\logg/\sqrt{\sigma_{\logg,stacked}^2 + \sigma_{\logg,visit}^2}$).
If our measurements were unbiased by S/N and the errors were representative, 
these values should be normally distributed with a zero mean and unit variance.
\stub{Are they? Should we inflate our formal errors?}


% Internal validation:
% --> bootstrap resampling of the training set?

% Identify outliers:
% --> Chi-sq of the sample.
% --> Convex hull? Distance to plane?
% --> Stars with morphological classification
% --> Anything else?

\subsection{External validation}

% External validation: 
% --> RAVE Data Release 4
% --> Gaia-ESO Survey
% --> APOGEE / EPIC (whichever was not used)
% --> Literature studies presented in Kordopatis+ 2014
% --> Gold standards (incl. exoplanet host star studies): Reddy (2003, 2006), Bensby (2014), Valenti & Fischer (2005)

\subsection{Astrophysical validation}
% Astrophysical validation:
% --> Identify globular clusters and look to see whether we capture "expected" abundance trends/spreads that are seen elsewhere in the literature
% --> Residuals as a function of galactic position? (DIBS)


\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:discussion}




\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

% We have introduced a non-parametric version of The Cannon that uses strict priors on line formation (censoring masks), and prior probability distributions on astrophysical parameters, using isochrones.
% We ran it on the entire RAVE spectra.
% We deliver effective temperature, surface gravity, and abundances of up to 8 elements for \Nstars.  Our internal and external validation tests suggest that we achieve a typical precision of X~K in $\teff$, 0.0X~dex in $\logg$, and $\approx{}X.XX$ in individual chemical abundances.  This catalog constitutes the largest collection of stellar abundances for stars in the first \project{Gaia} data release.  When combined with positions and 3D velocities from \project{Gaia}, the \project{UNRAVE} catalog will likely be crucial for understanding our local place in the Milky Way.
