Some info.

Compile the manuscript
======================

From your terminal:

````
  git clone https://github.com/AnnieJumpCannon/RAVE.git rave 
  cd rave/article
  make
````

The manuscript will now be compiled to `unrave.pdf`

If you have used `git` before, then please make your changes to the manuscript
**directly** in LaTeX and create a pull request. If you are not familiar with
`git`, then please make your manuscript suggestions in the form of a 
[GitHub issue](https://www.github.com/AnnieJumpCannon/RAVE/issues/new).
That way your comments can be included (on short notice!) in parallel, and
everyone can see the contributions from each co-author.
